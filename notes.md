# SVD
Original SVD file `CH56Xxx.svd` comes from MounRiver studio: https://www.mounriver.com/download

Related repo: https://github.com/lichtfeind/ch56x-svd-patch<br/>
I think the patches done by this repo have been upstreamed, at least as of MounRiver v2.3.0, which has v1.1 of the SVD...

During `svd2rust`, these warnings were initially shown:
```
[WARN  svd2rust::generate::device] No settings file provided for RISC-V target. Using legacy interrupts rendering
[WARN  svd2rust::generate::device] Please, consider migrating your PAC to riscv 0.12.0 or later
```
These are both generated by the same code path, so despite updating the `riscv` dependency in Cargo.toml, it still
warned on this. Found this relevant github issue: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/949
